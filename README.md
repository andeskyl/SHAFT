# SHAFT: Secure, Handy, Accurate and Fast Transformer Inference
This repository implements secure, handy, accurate and fast transformer inference based on [CrypTen](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CrypTen).

## Installing SHAFT
The following commands run successfully on Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.10.12.

## Running Experiments
We have a set of sub-directories in the `examples` directory for reproducible experimental results. Please refer to the `README.md` file in the sub-directories for instructions to run them.

1. `unit-test` - Costs of private softmax and GELU protocols.
2. `text-classification` - Private inference costs of BERT-base and BERT-large.
3. `text-generation` - Private inference cost of GPT-2.
4. `image-classification` - Private inference cost of ViT-base.
